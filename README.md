# Twitter-Airflow-AWS-Data-Engineering
This project uses the Tweepy Python package to fetch tweets and data of a Twitter user, and converts it into a CSV file. The CSV file is then uploaded to an S3 bucket using Apache Airflow on an EC2 instance on AWS.

The project provides a simple and automated way to collect and store Twitter data in a structured format that can be used for data analysis or further processing. The use of Apache Airflow makes it easy to schedule and manage the data collection process, while the use of AWS S3 ensures that the data is securely stored and easily accessible.

This project can be useful for individuals or organizations that want to collect and analyze Twitter data for research, marketing, or other purposes. It can also serve as a starting point for more complex data collection and analysis projects using Twitter data. Feel free to fork and use it for yourself.
